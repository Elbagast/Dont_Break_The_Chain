Don't Break the Chain
======================

A simple tool based on the motivational technique used by Jerry Seinfeld:

This isn't a huge wall calender, but rather something that will easily allow the same sort of thing
for say, lots of small tasks or types of things I should be doing in the day. This is deliberately
simple to use because it isn't aiming to be a tool for tracking workload - that's another project.

Will it work out? Well the Github squares seem to be working on me and that was basically a test run
of this sort of thing...

Todo:
- Saving and loading chains
- Selectable chain colours
- Presentation and size (alternative visualisations?)
- Make entirely Qt library based (?)

Compiling Notes
----------------
- Qt 5.4 library
- Boost 1.57 gregorian date library
